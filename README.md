# Timestamp

Android Wear complications for developers.

**Note:** This is an app built quickly for my own use; it may eventually
be developed into something useful for others, but for now it's available
as source only.

_Timestamp_ was created to provide a UTC time complication, displaying
24 hour time. Android Wear has a similar complication, however it requires
selecting Reykjav√≠k timezone (and having `REY` shown on the screen at all
times).

## Complications

* [x] UTC Time
* [ ] Unix Timestamp
