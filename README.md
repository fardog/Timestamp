# Timestamp

Android Wear complications for developers.

_Timestamp_ was created to provide a UTC time complication, displaying
24 hour time. Android Wear has a similar complication, however it requires
selecting Reykjav√≠k timezone (and having `REY` shown on the screen at all
times).

It also contains a time-since-epoch complication for watch faces which can
display a "long" text complication. Tapping this complication shows you the
current seconds or milliseconds since epoch, based on your selected settings.

## Installation

There are several options for installation:

* Install via the [Google Play Store][play]
* Sideload the [signed apk][apk] in this repository
* Build from source

The process for building/sideloading APKs varies from watch to watch, and is
not documented here. The project is a standard [Android Studio][studio]
project, and may be directly ported/built with no special considerations.

## Complications

* [x] UTC Time
* [x] Unix Timestamp
